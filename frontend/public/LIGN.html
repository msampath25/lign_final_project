<h3 class="course-subhead-2">HERITAGE LANGUAGE PROGRAM</h3>
<p>A &#8220;heritage&#8221; language is a language, typically spoken in the home, to which individuals are exposed during childhood. These heritage language speakers may learn to understand and speak this language to some degree but are usually more comfortable speaking the dominant language (e.g., English). The idea behind the department&#8217;s innovative Heritage Language Program is that heritage language students have a set of skills, competencies, and needs that are distinct from those of both native speakers learning to read and write the language for the first time, and also nonnative learners who may study it as a foreign language during adulthood. These students therefore require a different type of language instruction, one that builds on and enhances the linguistic skills they already possess and amplifies their cultural competence and literacy. The Heritage Language Program allows students to work toward developing higher levels of proficiency in order to pursue personal and professional goals.</p>
